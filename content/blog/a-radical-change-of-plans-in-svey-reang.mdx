The Pastors Conference in Svey Reang this month did not go as I expected.  I had prepared a lesson starting the book of Genesis and also had planned on reviewing the tests from the epistle Titus.  I got up at 4am and began my long journey to the village. I received a call, while eating breakfast an hour away from the church, that Pastor Sokohrn's wife had died the night before.  Pastor Sokorhn is the pastor of the church that we meet at so for obvious reasons we canceled the conference.  All the other church's pastors and I decided to go to his house anyways to comfort and be with him along with praying for his family.

Pastor Sokohrn's wife had been sick for about a year but got increasingly ill this last month so they had been taking her to Vietnam.  Healthcare in Cambodia is very poor so this is their best option in order for her to get the best treatment possible.  She passed away at the hospital at the age of 53.  She was 1 of 8 brothers and sisters whom are very close and she left behind her husband, two kids and grandchildren.  It was a very emotional day as we began to prepare for the funeral. But in all this grief there was a shining light as they performed a Christian funeral for her.  It is very cultural in Cambodia to do a traditional Buddhist funeral and if you don't do it you're considered to not love the person who has passed but Pastor Sokohrn held his ground knowing that she would want a Christian funeral and that it would be a testimony unto the Lord.  The day was consumed with lots of tears, lots of comforting, lots of stories, and lots of prayer.  Though there was incredible sorrow, there was also joy in having that assurance as a Christian that she is in heaven with our Lord Jesus Christ.


Some of the pastors came to me apologizing that the conference had been canceled and that I had still traveled all this way to their village and I reassured them that I was happy to be there with them because I love them and care for them personally.  It was a great time where they were able to see my heart a little bit more that I wasn't just there "on a mission" or trying to get a job done but that our friendship has value and that we are all one family in Jesus Christ. Please lift up Pastor Sokohrn's family and all of their friends in prayer as they go through this difficult time.

But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus. 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14
