Please keep Pastor Jeff and Christy in your prayers as they head to Cambodia next week for over a month. Their to-do list is long, but their first and most important priority is spending time with their grandkids and showing love to family and friends.


They deeply appreciate your prayers for safe travels. If you'd like to contribute to a special gift for the missionaries and children in Cambodia, please use the link below. Every dollar raised goes directly to them.
