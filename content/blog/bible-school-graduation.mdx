A day filled with joy! We were able to celebrate our second graduation at Water of Life Bible School. We are so proud of these 9 students who graduated today from the Bible school. This is not an easy achievement as they had to persevere through at least 16 courses of in depth Bible study. We have no doubt that they will go out into the world shining the light of Jesus everywhere they go. We can safely say that these men and women are equipped for ministry and life wherever the Lord leads them.


"All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work."

2 Timothy 3:16-17
