There's nothing more exciting to me than studying the Word of God with men and women who are so eager and passionate about the truth. We are at the mid-way point of our semester and the students are engaging with the material more than I could have expected. We are currently studying the books Romans and Genesis, along with a topical study in Evangelism. The Evangelism course has been a special blessing as the students are able to take what they are learning in the classroom and put it into practice in their everyday lives. It is so inspiring watching them share their testimonies and present the Gospel to their families and communities. Please continue to pray for the teachers and students to be filled with the Holy Spirit and grow in the knowledge of Him.
