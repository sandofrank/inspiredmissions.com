Hey Everyone!


A small team is departing to Cambodia on August 6th...  If you would like to support this mission team by purchasing something for the children's home Curtis and Bre work with, we have provided a link for your convenience.   We know this is a last minute ask but thought we would throw it out there just in case you want to bless the kids and teens at "Children of Hope."


As always the most important thing is prayer and we can't thank you all enough for your continued love and support.
