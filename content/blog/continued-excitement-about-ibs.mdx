Another fantastic Pastor's Conference happened in Kien Svay this last weekend. This group started fairly small but I can see God's hand and the interest in the area building. We were able to continue using the IBS method to better understand the Good Samaritan parable in Luke. I am so encouraged seeing everyone so excited about studying the Bible in greater depth.

Inductive Bible Study (IBS) involves examining the ideas and words of the text, which leads to the meanings and then the interpretations, which in turn lead the reader to conclusions and applications.  In inductive study, the reader will read a passage and then ask questions of how they personally interpret the verse(s). These questions can range from what the verse(s) literally means to how it applies to the believer's present personal circumstances. The purpose of these questions is to go deep enough into the text to extract the meaning and then to apply that gained knowledge to life.  God speaks to our lives directly through His word.
