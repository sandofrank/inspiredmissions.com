Some may ask why Inspired Missions exists.  Why do we do what we do? God's love inspires us to be missionaries to the world around us, even to South East Asia!  His love also inspires us to support those fulfilling this same love driven commitment.  To understand what it means to be a part of God's mission begins with the understanding that our Creator is a missionary God.

God is a sending God, with a desire to see humankind and creation reconciled, redeemed, and healed. God's mission can be seen throughout the pages of the Bible and history.  Nowhere is the mission of God better understood than in the person and work of Jesus Christ whom God sent as the ultimate missionary to mankind. John 3:16 tells us:

![John 3:16 Bible verse about God's love for the world](/images/blog/gods-mission-driven-love-2.jpeg)

"God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."

It really is just that simple.  As the Father sent Jesus, He also sends us to those who need Him in our time and culture. We have been chosen by God to live in this time and place in order to fulfill His mission of redemption and healing.  The mission of Christ continues in us to this very day.

At Inspired Missions we believe that God has called us to both send and support missionaries here and abroad to share the truth of the gospel and the love of God.
