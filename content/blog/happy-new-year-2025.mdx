It is with hearts full of gratitude and thankfulness that we celebrate another year in Cambodia with our missionaries. February 2025 marks 12 years for Curtis and Bre in full-time ministry in this amazing country. There are so many things to be grateful for, and it's really impossible to put them all into words.


The one thing we know and truly believe is that without each of you—your prayers, your time, and your giving of resources—this ministry would not be what it is today.

Blessings and Cheers to 2025!

Pastor Jeff and Christy Johnson
