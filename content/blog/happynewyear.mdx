It may seem like we're a few months late, but we just finished celebrating Khmer New Year, which takes place in mid-April. The dates shift each year because it's based on the lunar calendar. This is one of the biggest holidays in Cambodia—a time for family, rest, and celebration. The week is filled with traditional games, joyful chaos, water fights, and smearing baby powder on each other's faces!

We made the most of the break by taking the kids to the zoo and finding any water source we could to beat the heat. Pictures don't capture it, but with the humidity, it's been over 105°F day and night!

Praise Report!

The jungle church is growing! I had the opportunity to teach there on Palm Sunday and shared the story of the Triumphal Entry—something many of them were hearing for the very first time. Please keep praying for these new believers as they continue to grow in their faith. They need and welcome your prayers.
