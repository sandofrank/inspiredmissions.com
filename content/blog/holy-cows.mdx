Two more cows have been added to the fleet! Pastor Vean and Pastor Mihn are excited and feel blessed to begin the Cows for Christians program with their church families. Let us continue to pray for success and continued favor from above. There is a lot of upkeep and care needed to keep the cows healthy and happy.  Also pray that the Lord will continue to use this ministry to be His light in theses rural communities. We are grateful for everyone who made this possible.
