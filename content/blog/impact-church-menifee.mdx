Hi Everyone,


We love Sundays.  It's our time to spend the day with family and friends and go to church of course!  Even though we are across the world, we love that our USA home church "Impact Menifee" has a dedicated mission Sunday to highlight the happenings in Cambodia and all of the other missionaries Impact supports.  We want to thank our fellow missionaries from Mexico, Honduras, Africa and beyond who joined us to bring awareness to all of our missions. Thank You Impact Family; We were gifted 2 more cows and funds from many donors for interest free fertilizer loans to help with the sustainability of our Khmer family. You're generosity and prayers mean the world to us but most importantly, the many families that would have no resources otherwise.


On another related topic, travel from Cambodia to the USA has been challenging and we are hoping that it will be a possibility soon. Our biggest concern is with our 2 year old daughter and the challenges of international travel these days. We are praying that restrictions will lessen enough that we do not have to have her endure quarantine and other obstacles that are still being mandated over here. Please join us in prayer as we want to be able to visit family and friends stateside.

Thank you again for your love and support!!!

Send Me Lord,

Curtis, Bre and Harlow Johnson
