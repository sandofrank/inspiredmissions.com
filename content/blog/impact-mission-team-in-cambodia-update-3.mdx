Friday was a full day of planning and preparations for a very busy schedule on Saturday.

The morning kicked-off with Water of Life ("WOL") Bible School's VERY FIRST GRADUATING CLASS! This was the culmination of 2 years of dedicated study by these young men and women. Great job by Curtis Johnson and the entire WOL Bible School Team in opening and operating this school, developing the curriculum, and providing solid instruction. And the Impact Church family had a direct hand in making this graduation ceremony special by their generous giving which enabled the IMT to purchase and hand-deliver graduation caps and gowns used by this graduating class, and many more in the years to come!

That sounds like a really-full day, but there was more to do. The IMT conducted the first ever Vacation Bible School ("VBS") for Calvary Chapel Phnom Penh! It was a huge hit and blessing to all. But the wonderful VBS experienced by the kids wasn't the end result - the Team also trained and equipped the young men and women of WOL in conducting a VBS. They will now be able to hold ongoing VBS's in the city of Phnom Penh, and beyond into the Provinces of Cambodia in order to share the Good News!

Way to go IMT! We are with you in Spirit and in Prayer!
