The Impact Missions Team ("IMT") arrived safely in Cambodia after 26 hours of traveling - from Menifee to LAX to Seoul, South Korea, and then finally to Phnom Penh, Cambodia. As a point of reference, Cambodia is 14 hours ahead of Menifee (PDT), so by the time the IMT landed in the Capital City of Phnom Penh it was 11pm on Monday.

They are preparing to make an Impact, and that begins with time in the Word and Team Devotionals. One of the ambitious projects the IMT is tackling on this trip is designing and constructing a playground for the kids at Children of Hope. So one of the first stops in the planning was trip to the lumber yard. While this is in progress, they're also making preparations for the first Vacation Bible School at Calvary Chapel Phnom Penh this weekend.

Please keep everyone on the IMT in your prayers - for their strength and for the opportunities to minister to the people of Cambodia.
