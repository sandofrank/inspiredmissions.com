On Wednesday the Impact Missions Team ("IMT") traveled to Svay Rieng Province, which is a 3 to 4 hour drive southeast of Phnom Penh, and borders Vietnam. On Thursday Pastor Jeff and Curtis conducted Pastors Training by teaching through Exodus 1  and 2. Note that Curtis travels to this Province monthly to lead the Pastors Training. In addition, Kevin shared his his testimony with these church Pastors and Leaders!

Trisha and Marti held a mini-VBS with the children in the village (for approximately 25 kids), which was really special for them.


The IMT shared a meal with all those that gathered, and also gave out gifts to the Pastors and their wives (woven matts, sarongs, and towels), which really blessed them.

There was no time to rest as the Team had to get back to Phnom Penh (3 to 4 hour drive) for a VBS training on Thursday afternoon and evening!

Continue to pray for the Team; their adventures and opportunities to love, minister and bless the people of Cambodia while sharing the Good News; and for their travels and energy!
