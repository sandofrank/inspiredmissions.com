## Transportation

The only way to describe the transportation system in Cambodia is "organized-chaos." For example, the roads are heavily congested with "motos" (a motocycle or scooter). We are seeing more and more cars arriving in Cambodia, but motos rule the roads. Another challenge with the Cambodia transportation system is that the roads drastically vary in quality from the city (good at best) to the villages (non-maintained dirt roads). In rainy season the problems are magnified - the city streets flood to waist-deep water and the village roads turn to slippery clay. The city roads are narrow and pothole-ridden - we are talking deep holes in the middle of the road! Though the traffic laws are similar to America's driving laws, no one obeys them in Cambodia. Every law is treated as merely a suggestion and instead the people have "unspoken" laws that we abide by, and this means your mental awareness needs to be on point or you throw off the rhythm in which even more chaos ensues. This sounds stressful, as most times there's more chaos than organization, but we actually love driving here now and prefer it over the American way. Maybe we have lived here too long and have forgotten what a beautiful gift structure is. Whatever the case, driving in Cambodia is like playing real-life version of Frogger – it's definitely not for the faint of heart.

Curtis frequently travels out to some remote areas in Cambodia's Provinces to minister to the village churches and to equip and train church leaders there. The roads to these country destinations are practically nonexistent and it is essential to have a dirt bike that can handle the extremely rough terrain. In rainy season, many (if not most) of the roads to reach the village churches are inaccessible without an appropriate vehicle suited to the harsh terrain. He is in current need of a dirt bike that would be formidable for everyday use in Cambodia, as his previous moto was not suitable for all the roads and conditions that he must travel. This impairs Inspire Cambodia's mission as he has had has to cancel his monthly outreach in Svay Rieng at the present time due to the very poor condition of the roads. Only a sturdy and durable dirt bike can make it safely and reliably through these narrow, clay countryside roads. His 1995 AX-1 dirt bike has seen many good days in its life and has fulfilled its purpose, but it is time for its retirement. After many months of research - taking into account such factors as quality, reliability, dependability, and maintenance accessibility (we do not have access to a wide-variety of vehicle parts here) - Curtis has found one worthy of investment for our mission: it is a KTM Enduro 400cc motorcycle that was manufactured in 2009.

We have prayed over this decision and are confident that this is the Lord's direction. As such, we know that He will provide the funding necessary to make this happen. Would you please pray for this need to be met, and to seek the Lord's direction if He has called you to donate to help meet this transportation need?

Dear friend, you are being faithful to God when you care for the traveling teachers who pass through, even though they are strangers to you. They have told the church here of your loving friendship. Please continue providing for such teachers in a manner that pleases God.~ 3 John 5:6 (NLT)

Thank you, and may God richly Bless You!
