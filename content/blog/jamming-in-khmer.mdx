This months pastor's conference in Svey Reang was a very special one. Many months back, we were able to give out many Bibles and songbooks to the believers with the help of Impact Church.  I have been tirelessly learning their classic hymns for the last couple of months and when I arrived to the church they had a guitar and asked if I could play.  I started playing some worship songs from their hymn book. They were super excited so they started pulling out some of their instruments and we had a little Khmer jam session.  Then to their surprise I started playing some of their classic pre-Khmer Rouge rock songs with them.

For those who don't know, the Khmer Rouge (who was responsible for a genocide of over 2 million Cambodians) targeted educated and artistic people.  Due to this devistating genocide, most of their music was lost and destroyed, but there were a few albums and songs that lasted,  So to surprise them, I have learned to play a few of them and it seemed to really bless them, especially Pastor Sokhorn whose wife recently passed away.  For a small second, he was able to put aside his current hardships and get lost in the old music.  There was a great sense of fellowship and love this month which was encouraging to all of the us. I love to see how our relationships with each other have matured.  It's truly ordained by the Lord.

"O come, let us sing for joy to the LORD, Let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation. Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, Let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms. For the LORD is a great God And a great King above all gods,"‭‭Psalms‬ ‭95:1-3‬ ‭NASB‬‬

God bless you all...  Curtis
