It's been an incredible season of growth and transformation on Phnom Chi, a mountain deep in the jungle that has been on our hearts for over a decade. After years of faithfully sowing seeds, God is moving in a mighty way, and we are beginning to see His Word take root in a community that was once spiritually dry.

For years, my dear friend Mordegai has been leading outreach efforts in this area. Armed with his medical skills and a heart full of Christ's love, Mordegai has spent about 15 years trekking to these remote villages, treating physical ailments while sharing the hope of the gospel. I had the privilege of joining him 8 years ago, and together, we've worked tirelessly to build relationships, care for the people's needs, and share the Good News.

In those early years, most people would politely listen to the message of Jesus. They respected His teachings but stopped short of making a personal commitment. We continued to serve, love, and pray for them, trusting that God was at work behind the scenes. And now, after years of persistence, we're witnessing a spiritual breakthrough.


#### A Growing Church in the Jungle

A little over a year ago, something changed. Several families who had heard the gospel began to feel a stirring in their hearts. They confessed their faith in Christ and expressed a deep hunger to know more of the Truth. These new believers described feeling like sheep without a shepherd — isolated on the mountain with no nearby church to support their growth in faith.

In response, Mordegai and I made more frequent trips to teach them foundational Christian truths. However, due to the logistical challenges of making weekly trips, we knew this approach wasn't sustainable. That's when God provided the perfect solution. A local pastor, who had joined us on many of these outreaches over the years and had a heart for this community, stepped in to take on the role of shepherd. Since September, he has faithfully traveled to Phnom Chi every week to disciple this growing group of believers.


#### A Major Step of Faith: Baptism

This past week, something remarkable happened — these new believers asked to be baptized. In a country where Buddhism is the dominant religion and public declarations of faith in Christ can bring significant challenges, this is no small step. Their desire to publicly confess their faith in Jesus Christ is a powerful testimony to the transformation happening in their hearts and in their community.

Baptism is a bold proclamation that they are no longer walking in darkness but in the light of Christ. It is also a signal to their neighbors and family members that their lives are now marked by hope, joy, and a relationship with the one true God.


#### What's Next?

Please join us in prayer for these new believers. Pray that their faith would deepen and that their lives would shine brightly in a region that has long been spiritually dark. Our hope is that this small gathering will grow into a thriving church community and that the fire of the gospel will spread across the mountain, bringing hope and salvation to many more.

We know that God's work on Phnom Chi is far from over. There are still many people who have yet to hear the gospel or fully embrace it. But we are encouraged by the signs of revival we're witnessing and are committed to continuing this mission, trusting that God will bring lasting change to this once-overlooked corner of the world.

Thank you for your prayers and support. This journey has been long and sometimes challenging, but it's moments like this — witnessing lives changed for His glory — that remind us it's all worth it.

May the light of Christ continue to shine brightly on Phnom Chi and beyond.
