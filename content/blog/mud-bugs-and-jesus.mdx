What an amazing adventure we had with the team from Impact Church! This group was all guys, so we embraced extreme adventures, pushing our physical and mental limits. We took to the jungle on motorcycles, delivering mosquito nets, medicine, and the gospel. Cambodia is in the midst of the rainy season, so the roads (more like makeshift trails) were almost non-existent, with many sections waist-deep in mud and water. Despite the challenges, it was all worth it to see the joy on the Khmer faces as they welcomed us and the much-needed supplies.

The Lord is moving powerfully in the area. Many people are starting to believe in Christ and want to meet weekly to learn how to follow Jesus. In the past couple of weeks, we've even seen a house church start! Please continue to pray for them.

In the city, we spent time with the kids from Children of Hope, sharing pizza, soccer, and volleyball. We also completed building projects, resulting in two new pulpits for local churches. Steve taught woodworking skills to the eager youth, who were excited to learn something new. We also took time to visit important cultural sites, including the Killing Fields, S21, and Angkor Wat. Understanding Cambodia's culture and history, along with serving its people, is our passion.

Of course, we couldn't let the team leave without sampling some of the local cuisine—tarantulas and grasshoppers. Yummy! Even though the team was here for a short time, we are grateful for the light they brought and pray we'll see them again soon. They're welcome back anytime!
