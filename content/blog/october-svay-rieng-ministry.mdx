I went out so Svay Rieng this weekend and had a great time dissecting the Word with the pastors. We are going through the book of Genesis and are having a great time doing it.  Please continue to keep the pastors in your prayers as our passion is to help them discover truth for themselves by teaching the Inductive Bible Study Method.    -Curtis
