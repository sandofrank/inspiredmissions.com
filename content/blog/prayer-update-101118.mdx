We were married in 2013 and immediately began our life journey together as missionaries in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, sent by Calvary Hills Church (now Impact Church) in Southern California. In Cambodia we serve with a Christian organization, Water of Life ("WOL"). More specifically, Breann serves at WOL's childrens home, Children of Hope ("COH"), while Curtis directs and teaches at the Water of Life Bible School. As missionaries our jobs aren't easily defined, as we both have several other responsibilities and outreaches in which we lead and participate. Our heart is to disciple and raise up the Cambodian people to be effective leaders in their church, community, and family through the power of the Word and His love. We appreciate all of your prayers and firmly believe in the power of Christ and His church. So thank you for praying with us and for us.


### Prayer Requests

<IconPrayer position="right" size="md" color="accent" />

- Praise God Bre and all the COH kids survived Katherine's (COH Director) 2-month furlough in the US! During this time Bre worked herself to the bone and had little sleep, but thanks to your prayers and the Lord she had enough strength and wisdom to keep everything running like usual. Also, Katherine was able to have a good refreshing trip in the States.
- Praise God that Pastor Sokhorn (a village pastor in Svay Rieng Province) has found a solution to the complicated legal problem he was in. God always provides a way!
- Continue to pray for the COH kids to excel in school and learn how to trust in the Lord for all things.
- The WOL Bible School is in full-swing. Pray for the students to have a continued passion for the Word and to grow in their faith.
- Continue to pray against the spiritual darkness and attacks of the enemy. This is an especially dark time as their version of Halloween (Pchum Ben) is this month.
