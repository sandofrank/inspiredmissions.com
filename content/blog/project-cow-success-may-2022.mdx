We are proud to say we have bought our first cow as a result of your faithful giving.  We have a wonderful family to take care of her,Pastor Sokhorn and his wife, who are dear friends of ours.  We have seen and experienced their faithfulness and reliability over many years.


Here's the plan moving forward:  The local pastors that we minister with in the rural areas are entrusted to care for each cow we purchase.  They are encouraged to be a good example to the church members who will participate in "Project Cow" after them.  This journey is ever changing as the price and process of obtaining and caring for each cow will be different. There is no such thing as a cattle store here in Cambodia, but who would have predicted raising a cow would be a new undiscovered path to discipleship and stewardship.

Since there is no cattle store, local pastors have to search from farm to farm (Mom and Pop style farms) to locate a cow that will best serve their church and family.  It is so incredibly encouraging to see the pastor's eagerness and willingness to search out a cow that will bless their family and church in such a big way!

We will be purchasing several more cows in the coming months so stay tuned. We want to be intentional and prayerful for each cow that is purchased.  We will continue to keep you all updated. Thank you again for all of those who have contributed and who will continue to support "Project Cow."
