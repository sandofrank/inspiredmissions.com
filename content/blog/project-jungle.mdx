Where the roads are usually non existent and travel is difficult. Curtis teams up with other missionaries to bring the word of God to these rural Cambodian Villages. They come prepared with bibles, audio bibles in the Khmer language, medical supplies and whatever else they can bring to bless these communities. Donations for this project go directly to enable the missionaries to travel and buy necessary supplies to the jungles of Cambodia.
