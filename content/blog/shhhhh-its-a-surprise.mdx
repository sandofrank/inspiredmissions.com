Pastor Jeff and Christy are heading to Cambodia on August 12—just a few short days away! Since they will be there for a month, they have some special (surprise) projects planned to bless the kids and missionaries. They've got some fun building projects in the works and would love your support for supplies. They'll be purchasing playground equipment in Cambodia, so if you'd like to contribute, please select "Greatest Need" on the Inspired website. Stay tuned for pictures!
