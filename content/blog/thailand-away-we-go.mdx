We are off to Chiang Mai Thailand this July for 3 weeks!

<IconCommunity position="right" size="md" color="secondary" />

We have been asked to guest teach at Refuge Fellowship (Calvary Chapel) to fill in for a fellow missionary family while they are on furlough in the US. The church was planted by Pastor Aaron Moon. They have 60-80 people strong, with a congregation made up of people who are Thai, Burmese, American, British, German, Egyptians, Australian, Chinese and Filipino. We are excited to help in any way possible and to be a blessing to our fellow Thailand missionaries…. Please join us in praying over this church, ministry, and community. If you would like to assist with expenses for this mission under the donate tab on our website please write "Thailand" in the comment section.

Thank you in advance for your prayers,

Blessings from Curtis, Bre and Harlow Johnson
