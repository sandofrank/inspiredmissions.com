The 2016 Asia/Pacific Rim Conference will be in Chaing Mai, Thailand from September 26th through 29th. The theme of this year's conference is: "The Harvest is Ripe". This is an important gathering of pastors, church planters and missionaries at a time when doors are open to the Gospel in Southeast Asia. This conference is for those who share that heart for God's work in Asia and the Pacific Rim countries to come and connect with others. It is also a vital time for present and future missionaries to gather together for vision sharing, fellowship, and encouragement and "to stir up love and good works" in each other (Heb. 10:24).

The cost for the 2016 Asia/Pacific Rim Conference is $180 per person which includes the conference fee, lodging, and most meals. Additional costs to attend this Conference are round-trip airfare at $300 per person, Thailand travel visa fees at $40 per person, and miscellaneous travel and meal expenses which we estimate at $75 per person.

We are confident that the 2016 Asia/Pacific Rim Conference will be beneficial as we continually seek the Lord's direction for current and future ministry opportunities to share the Gospel and disciple Christian brothers and sisters in Cambodia. We ask each of you to prayerfully consider giving any amount to help fund our expenses to attend the 2016 Asia/Pacific Rim Conference.

Donations for this Conference can be made online using the "One Time Gift" option at:  https://www.inspiredmissions.com/support/

Thank you for your prayers and for your support.

Grace and Peace,

Curtis and Bre
