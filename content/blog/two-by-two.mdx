### Water of Life Bible School (WOLBS)

<IconBible position="left" size="md" color="primary" />

At the Bible School, we strive to teach the students the value of God's Word and how to practically use it in everyday Christian life. In the Evangelism course we accomplished just that! As I've witnessed the students' love for dissecting the Word, this last semester we decided to put that into action because we know if there isn't an answer to God's call for us, our studies are all in vain.

Pastor Kurt Kula is passionate about reaching out to our surrounding communities imploring and encouraging our students to share the truth of God's word. So, we decided to merge our two passions. WOLBS students went out to Steung Mean Chey and Mercy village, going door-to-door, sharing their personal testimonies and the simplicity of the gospel. Pastor Kurt and I (Curtis) saw a huge change in the students from that day on. The students were able to witness to people hungry for hope, hungry for the Gospel. The students seemed to dig their heels deeper in the idea of the "Body" in action. It was a testament to how the Lord breaks down the barriers of fear as He uses them.

This December/January semester we will be studying the book of Romans taught by me, and the book of Daniel taught by Kurt Kula. We are also having a condensed week-long course of Inductive Bible Study taught by Drew Macintyre. Please continue to lift up these students and our teachers in prayer. Most of them are full-time university students and taking bible courses at night at WOLBS. Also, please keep in prayer the growth of the school as we look to reach students within Water of Life and beyond.

Mark 16:15 ~ "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation."

2 Timothy 3:16 ~ "Equipping the saints for every good work."


### Pastor Training


#### Perseverance

<IconCommunity position="left" size="md" color="accent" />

One of the first calls the Lord put on my heart once moving to Cambodia was to encourage and strengthen the churches, deep in the province of Svay Reang. Over the last 6 years I (Curtis) have been traveling to the province once a month to meet with a core group of approximately twenty local Svay Reang pastors. Despite economical, educational, and physical issues endured daily by these pastors and their churches, they faithfully come to every conference, and are prepared with their bibles and notes to dig deeper into the Word, especially the Old Testament.

A long time member of our group and now dear friend of mine, Pastor Samean (Sah-Me-An) shared with me how much he enjoys learning more about the Word. He has expressed a desire to reach more pastors by bringing this training closer to his area. Every month he travels over an hour each way to get to the conference. When I went there in November he asked if I would start the same conference in his area for his church congregation. While praying about it, the Lord made it clear, almost immediately. Beginning in January we are looking to start another conference in the same province but a different village that is more accessible to other pastors who are interested in joining. Please lift this decision up in prayer. I need wisdom to sort out the details in a way that this project will be complimentary to the surrounding churches.

#### God's faithfulness

<IconHeart position="right" size="md" color="primary" />

We have been serving in Cambodia for 6 years. As we began this journey we had no idea what the Lord had planned for us (we thought this was a one year commitment), but we stepped out in faith and just had to trust the Lord. We have never looked back.

It has not always been smooth sailing as we have had our fair share of trials and struggles, but what better way to stay humble before the Lord. He is merciful and He is always good. Every year, month, and day we have to cast our worries aside and put our trust in the Lord, which is easier said than done. We are so grateful for everyone who continues to support us prayerfully, emotionally, and financially. It is comforting to know that despite the miles between us we are all one family in Christ.

1 Thessalonians 5:24 ~ "Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass."

We are immensely grateful for all of you that have come alongside us – both prayerfully and financially – on this journey. Your generous financial support enables us to fulfill God's purpose in our lives in Cambodia in each and every area we are called to minister and serve. We honestly can't begin to express how much each and every one of you mean to us.

Please continue to pray for us and our work for the Gospel in Cambodia. We would love to hear from you – it's really a blessing for us being so far from home. You can email us at CJohnson@InspiredMissions.com or you can post a Message or Comment on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/MissionsInspired

Lastly, we ask that you would prayerfully consider financially supporting our work here in Cambodia. To pledge a recurring or one-time gift please visit https://www.inspiredmissions.com/support/ and complete the online form. A mailing address is also noted at the above link in the event that you would like to send your support via check.

Thank you. May you have a very Merry and Blessed Christmas!
