Hi family and friends,

<IconPrayer position="left" size="md" color="primary" />

Thank you to everyone who has reached out in light of the recent news about tensions between Cambodia and Thailand. We truly appreciate your care and concern. We've waited to send an update until we could get a clearer picture of what's actually happening.

Border tensions between Cambodia and Thailand have existed for years, but things have recently escalated with both sides engaging in military action. Thankfully, we are safe here in Phnom Penh, which is about eight hours from the border where the conflict is taking place. For now, there's no indication that the fighting will move beyond those areas.

Please pray for our friends in Siem Reap and near the border — they are much closer to the conflict. Many people are fleeing the border regions and heading into Siem Reap to seek safety.

Quick summary of the situation:

There's a longstanding border dispute involving land near ancient Khmer temples. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) previously ruled the land belongs to Cambodia, but Thailand has not recognized the ruling, and tensions have continued to rise. In recent weeks, both nations have exchanged fire, with each blaming the other for starting the conflict.

Adding to the instability, Thailand is experiencing its own internal political unrest, including the suspension and reinstatement of its prime minister. The combined pressures have displaced over 150,000 Cambodians from their homes due to military strikes near the border.

Despite the chaos, the resilience of the Cambodian people is powerful. Communities are stepping up to help those displaced, and we're praying for a lasting peace. While both countries have agreed to a ceasefire, it has yet to hold.

We'd love your continued prayers — for our family's safety, for Cambodia, and especially for our ministry partners in the north who are directly helping thousands of displaced people. In the midst of fear and uncertainty, many are more open than ever to spiritual conversations. We're grateful to be here at such a crucial time, pointing people to hope in Jesus.

Thanks again for your love and support!
