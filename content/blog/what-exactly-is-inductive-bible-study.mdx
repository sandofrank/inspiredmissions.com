"Inductive" means we use the Bible as the primary source of study to learn about God and what the Bible teaches.  We pray that you consider these study methods just like the village Pastors in Cambodia.

Individual study is the first step. Group discussion based observations and insights from personal study are encouraged. It is in the discussion, for many, that the lesson begins to "hit home". The study group confirms, clarifies, and corrects as each student seeks to discover the truth for themselves. Discussion of the Bible's truths helps to solidify them in our minds and sharing about life application encourages individuals to live out what they are learning. In this approach, spending time to know what the Bible says, understanding what it means, and living it out in our daily life, results in a life that honors Jesus.


### The Inductive Bible Study Technique is investigative using three basic components:

#### Observation:  discover what it says

1. Start with Prayer:  Prayer is often the missing element in Bible study. You are about to learn the most effective technique of Bible study there is. Yet apart from the work of the Holy Spirit, that's all it will be—a technique.
2. Ask the "5 W's and and the H":  As you study any passage of Scripture, train yourself to constantly ask: Who? What? When? Where? Why? How? These questions are the building blocks of observation, which is essential for accurate interpretation.
3. Mark key words and phrases:  A key word is one that is critical to the text. Key words and phrases are repeated in order to communicate  the author's point or purpose for writing. For example, notice that some form of the word suffering is used three times in 1 Peter 5. Key words can be marked using symbols, colors, or both.
4. Make lists:  Making a list can be one of the most productive things you do as you study. Lists restate truths and reinforce important concepts. 1 Peter 5:2-3, for example, contains a simple list regarding the role of the elder, shown by numbering the items in the verse. It is also helpful to make a list of what you learn about each key word or person you mark.
5. Watch for contrasts and comparisons:  Contrasts and comparisons paint word pictures to make it easier to remember what you've learned. For example, Peter compares the devil to a roaring lion in verse 8. Peter also contrasts God's view of the proud and the humble.
6. Note expressions of time:  The relationship of events in time often clarify the true meaning of the text. Marking "time" will help you see the order or timing of events and lead to more accurate interpretation of Scriptures.
7. Geographic Locations:  Often it is helpful to mark geographical locations which tell you where a particular event takes place.
8. Mark words of conclusion:  Words such as therefore, thus and for this reason tell us that a conclusion or summary is being made. You may want to underline them in the text.

#### Interpretation:  discover what it means

1. Remember that context rules: The word "context" means that which goes with the text. If you lay the solid foundation of observation, you will be prepared to look at each verse in the light of the surrounding verses, the book in which it is found, and the entire Word of God. As you study, ask yourself: Is my view on this passage of Scripture consistent with the theme, purpose, and structure of the book in which it is found? Is it consistent with other Scripture about the same subject? Am I considering the historic and cultural context? Never take a Scripture out of its context to make it say what you want it to say. Discover what the author is saying; don't add to his meaning.
2. Always seek the full counsel of the Word of God:  When you know God's Word thoroughly, you will not accept a teaching simply because someone has used one or two isolated scriptures to support it. Those verses may have been taken out of context or other scriptures overlooked or ignored that would have led to a different conclusion. As you read the Bible more in total, you will be able to discern whether a teaching is biblical or not. Know the Word of God; it is your safeguard against wrong doctrine.
3. Remember that Scripture will never contradict Scripture: The best interpretation of Scripture is Scripture. Remember, all Scripture is inspired by God. It is God breathed. Therefore, Scripture will never contradict itself. Sometimes, however, you may find it difficult to reconcile two seemingly contradictory ideas taught in Scripture, such as the sovereignty of God and the responsibility of man. Don't take a teaching to an extreme that God doesn't. Simply humble your heart in faith and believe what God says, even if you can't fully understand or reconcile it at the moment.
4. Don't base your convictions on an obscure passage of scripture:  An obscure passage is one in which the meaning is not easily understood. Because they are difficult to understand they should not be used as a basis for establishing doctrine.
5. Interpret Scripture literally:  The Bible is not a book of mysticism. God spoke to us that we might know truth. Therefore, take away the Word of God at face value - in it's natural, normal sense. Look first for the clear teaching of Scripture, not a secondary hidden meaning.
6. Look for the single meaning of the passage:  Always try to understand what the author had in mind when you interpret a portion of the Bible. Don't twist verses to support a meaning that is not clearly taught. Unless the author indicates that there is another meaning to what he says, let the scripture speak for itself.

#### Application:  discover what it means practically

<IconTree position="right" size="sm" color="primary" />

1. Believe:  Usually this is the first thing we want to know when we read the Bible, but life application actually begins with belief which then results in being and doing. Once you know what a passage means, you are not only responsible for putting it into practice in your own life, but accountable if you don't!  Ultimately, then, the goal of Inductive Bible study is a transformed life and a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ.
2. Application is not a third step in the inductive process:  Application takes place as you  are  confronted  with  truth  and  decide  to respond in obedience to that truth. The basis for application is 2 Timothy 3:16-17: All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.
3. How observation, interpretation, and application relate to each other:  Accurate interpretation and correct application rest on the accuracy of your observations. Therefore, it is vital that you develop observation skills, even if at first they seem time-consuming or you feel less than adequate and even awkward doing them. Studying inductively is a learning process that does not happen overnight.  It happens by doing—doing over and over again, until the doing becomes almost a habit, and a wonderful one at that.
4. Bring truth against what you believe and how you are living:  As you go through the inductive process, you'll sometimes find observation, interpretation, and application happening simultaneously. God can give you insight at any point in your study, so be sensitive to His leading. When words or passages make an impression on you, stop for a moment and meditate on what God has shown you.
5. Put His truths into practice:  Through a diligent study of God's Word, under the guidance of His Spirit, you'll drop a strong anchor that will hold in the storms of life. You will know your God. And when you know your God, not only will you be strong, but you will do great exploits for Him (Daniel 11:32). When you know what God says, what He means, and how to put His truths into practice, you will be equipped for every circumstance of life.
