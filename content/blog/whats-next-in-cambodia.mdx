As we mentioned in our last post, we are incredibly excited about the Pacific Rim conference coming up in Sept.  Thank you to those of you who are praying for us and who have provided some of the funding needed to make the conference.  There is still a need for more support to make it happen but we trust in the Lord's provision.

There is so much more going on than this one conference.  We are still making trips once per month to Svey Reang and Kiem Svay to train local pastors in inductive Bible study techniques. This takes quite a bit of preparation but the results are worth every bit of it.  If you would like to see what is happening and pray for or support these efforts, please check out our "About Cambodia Page."  We'll have all of the training and ministry dates posted for you to see so you can be there with us in prayer.  We'll report back soon about the amazing things God is going to do this weekend!
